			&emsp;&emsp;The inception of this repository is aimed at creating a one-stop shop for all common 
			and most asked questions about <b>Java</b> programming language in an interview setting. The list
			of current contributors is as follows:

		About Java
		</h2>
			
		<p style="font-family:cambria; font-size:120%; color:#202020; text-align:justify;">
			&emsp;Java was developed by <b>Sun Microsystems Inc.</b> in the year 1991, later acquired by <b>Oracle Corporation</b>. 
			It was developed by <b>James Gosling</b> and <b>Patrik Naughton</b>. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming 
			language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Java applications are compiled
			to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

		<ul style="list-style-type: disc; font-family:cambria; font-size:120%; color:#202020; text-align:justify;">
			<li><i>Java Development Kit (JDK)</i>:<br>&emsp;&emsp; It is a complete kit that includes everthing including compiler, 
			Java Runtime Environment (JRE), debuggers, samples, documentation etc.</li><br>
			
			<li><i>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</i>:<br>&emsp;&emsp;  JVM executes the bytecode generated by the Java compiler.</li><br>
			
			<li><i>Bytecode</i>:<br>&emsp;&emsp;  Javac compiler of JDK compiles the Java source code into bytecode so that 
			it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as .class file by the compiler.</li><br>
			
			<li><i>Java Runtime Environment (JRE)</i>:<br>&emsp;&emsp;  JDE includes JRE to run the java programs after compilation.</li><br>
			
			<li><i>Garbage Collector</i>:<br>&emsp;&emsp;  For memory management, JVM has a program that take care to recollect the memory 
			that are not referenced. This program is known as Garbage collector.</li><br>

			<li><i>ClassPath</i>:<br>&emsp;&emsp;  This is a file path where Java runtime and Java compiler search for .class files and external libraries to load.</li>
